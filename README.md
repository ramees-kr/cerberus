- Integration of DNS packet monitoring with a dynamic web-based dashboard
- Machine learning model trained on a Kaggle dataset to classify URLs as malicious or benign
- Interactive dashboard for visualizing real-time DNS packet analysis and taking immediate action on identified threats

## Technologies Used

- Python
  - Scapy
  - Flask
  - SocketIO
- Machine Learning
  - Logistic Regression
